HR Question: How Do You Handle Stress or Pressure?

When I face stress or pressure, I first try to stay calm and understand what exactly is causing it. In my daily life, this usually happens when I have multiple tasks to complete in a limited time, such as balancing learning, personal responsibilities, and deadlines.

Instead of panicking, I break the work into smaller tasks and focus on completing one thing at a time. This helps me feel more in control and reduces stress.

For example, during my preparation for placements, there are days when I feel pressured to learn many topics at once. On such days, I prioritize the most important task, complete it first, and then move on to the next.

I also make sure to take short breaks, which helps me refresh my mind and maintain focus. By staying organized and taking a practical approach, I am able to handle pressure effectively and continue working productively.

Shorter Version:

When I feel stressed, I first try to understand what is causing it instead of panicking. In my daily life, this usually happens when I have multiple tasks or deadlines. I handle it by breaking the work into smaller steps and focusing on one task at a time.

For example, during my placement preparation, when I feel pressure to cover many topics, I prioritize the most important one and complete it first. This helps me stay calm, organized, and productive even under pressure.
